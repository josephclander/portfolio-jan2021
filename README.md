# Portfolio Jan 2021

The portfolio shows a snapshot of the sites and apps I have built up to Jan 2021.

## Tools

- **Gulp**: task runner to create the production version of the site
- **Sketch**: to plan and design the look across multiple devices

## Notes

I created this portfolio site as a final assignment piece on the Treehouse Frontend Developer Techdegree. The requirements to pass are included in [project_requirement](./project_requirements.md).
