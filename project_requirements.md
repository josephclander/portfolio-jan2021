# Project Requiements

## Instructions

1. Mobile first design.

   - Create a mobile first site that works well on mobile phones and desktop computers.
   - The design should be easy to use on smaller screen sizes as well as on the desktop.
   - 320px is the smallest screen size you will need to test your design on.
   - Make sure the HTML files include the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".

2. Images that link to at least 4 other projects.

   - The images can be images of your projects, icons, or whatever other visual represents the project.
   - You need to link to other web projects. You can use some (or all) of the projects you've completed in this program. You can include the files for those projects along with the portfolio pages

3. A short description of each project and the skills you used to build it.

   - Employers want to know what you can do, so let them know what the project was and what you used to build it.
   - For example, if you include Project #7 -- the SVG Web Site Update -- you could describe what you did (replaced raster images with scalable vector graphics) and the skills you used -- HTML, CSS and an understanding of SVGs.

4. Contact information

   - You'll want employers to be able to find and contact you.
   - You should include information like email, Twitter and LinkedIn profile links. If you don't want to share this information for this project, no problem, just make these up.

5. At least one example of JavaScript interactivity.
   - For example, you could use the pop-up effect from Project #5, the Interactive Photo Gallery. Or, use JavaScript or jQuery to trigger CSS transition effects or animations.
   - Have fun with this -- JavaScript is an important part of front end web development, so providing multiple examples of your JavaScript abilities will impress employers.

## Extra Credit

- Create a breakpoint for tablet displays.
- Link to more than 4 projects.
- Use SVG images for contact information icons.
- Multiple JavaScript interactions.
